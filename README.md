### How to add a post

1. Create a folder in the ```content``` path. Since folder's name will not be used in any part of site, you can rename it as you want in order to organize better your contents (ex. ```2019-01-20-my-post```).
2. In this folder create a file ```index.md```.
3. At the beginning of file, insert two ```---```, one above of the other. They are separators to define post's metatags.
4. Between above two separators, insert metatags. They are couples key/value to define additional info useful for process your post. Read [here](#How-edit-metatags-of-a-post) for more info about them.
5. Under the second separator ```---``` write your post using [Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).

### How to edit metatags of a post

Metatags are additional informations that you provide in your posts to allow them to be processed correctly.
Some metatags are used for some site's features and others for SEO purposes. You have to list all fields but you can omit values of non-mandatory ones.
Here a table for list them and explain how use each one.

| **Metatag name** | **Description** | **Mandatory (Yes/No)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| title | The title of your post | Y |
| path | (Relative) url path of your post | Y |
| date | Date of your post | Y |
| tags | Tags to which your post belongs | Y |
| excerpt | A brief summary of your post | N |
| cover | Relative path of post's image preview | Y |

*Example*
```
title: My new blog post
path: blog/my-new-blog-post
date: 2019-01-20
tags: [technology, seo, writing]
excerpt: In this post we'll see a post example...
cover: ./preview.png
```

### How to add a translated version of a post

1. Choose in the ```content``` path the folder of the post to translate.
2. Place here the translated version of post and rename the file with the [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code according to its language (ex. ```index.it.md```, ```index.de.md```).

You've finished! Now in your post you'll get a link to translated version and viceversa.

Metatags for [SEO](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077) are automatically added in each version of post pages using the ISO code choosen for the filename. Tags will only be added for posts with translated versions.
Note that for ```index.md```, the ISO code used in metatags is taken from the ```config.js```' variable ```defaultLanguage```.

### How to change themes

Themes available with this starter are in ```src/style/themes```, but you can also create your own following these as example. Import what you prefer in ```src/style/index.less``` file.
